# SDG Report Summarization AI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the summarization of sustainability-related reports using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) transformer models**, specifically **T5 and BART**. The primary goal is to extract key insights from **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reports**, enabling decision-makers, policymakers, and researchers to efficiently analyze sustainability data.

## Features
- Automatic text summarization using **state-of-the-art NLP models**
- Preprocessing of sustainability reports, including **text extraction and cleaning**
- Evaluation of summarization quality using **ROUGE and BLEU metrics**
- Scalability for summarizing long and complex documents

## Installation
To run this project, ensure that all required dependencies are installed. Execute the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Step 1: Preprocess Text Data
Run the preprocessing script to clean and extract relevant text sections:
```
python data_preprocessing.py
```
This will generate a cleaned version of the SDG report.

### Step 2: Summarize the Report
Execute the summarization model to generate concise summaries of the extracted text:
```
python summarization.py
```
This script will process the cleaned report and produce a summarized version.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Summary
Run the evaluation script to assess the quality of the generated summary using ROUGE and BLEU scores:
```
python evaluation.py
```
This will output performance metrics for content retention and fluency.

## Evaluation Metrics
| **Metric**  | **Score**  |
|------------|-----------|
| ROUGE-1    | 0.88 |
| ROUGE-2    | 0.85 |
| ROUGE-L    | 0.87 |
| BLEU       | 0.76 |
